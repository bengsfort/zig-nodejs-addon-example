# Zig Node.js Addon Example

This is a very basic example of writing a native addon for node.js with Zig, as a simplistic example of what the flow looks like and how it works. This currently uses the raw node.js API's, but could be improved by utilizing the node-addon-api package instead which as a much nicer-to-use API that is less verbose.
